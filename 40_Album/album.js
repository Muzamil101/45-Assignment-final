// 40. Album: 
// Write a function called make_album() that builds an Object describing a music album. The 
// function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing 
// these two pieces of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
// albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. 
// If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the album’s Object. Make 
// at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album
