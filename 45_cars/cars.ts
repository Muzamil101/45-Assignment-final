// receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword 
// arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as 
// a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
// stored correctly
